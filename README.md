# deliverymap

I am a Red Cross volunteer Meals on Wheels delivery driver. When I pickup the meals from the hospital, I get a clipboard of printed paper with the addresses and orders to deliver to.

I want to see if I can use R to:
* take in photos of the delivery sheets and obtain a list of delivery addresses
* open google maps with a delivery route containing each address as a waypoint
